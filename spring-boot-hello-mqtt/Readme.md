# Spring Boot MQTT Integration

## Setup

Credentials are meant to be read from an .env file in the source of the project with these values:
```txt
mqtt_username=<fillme>
mqtt_password=<fillme>
```

## Data

In resources, a *nodered* flow is attached. It is a little hardcoded to my mosquitto installation for now.
